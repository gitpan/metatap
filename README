INTRODUCTION:

metatap is a simple testing tool for TAP producers. It reads TAP from standard 
input, along with the expected results on the command line. It then produces 
(and optionally runs) TAP describing how the input TAP was interpreted by 
TAP::Harness.

For example, if you send to following TAP:

  1..5
  ok 1 - 1 equals 1
  ok 2 - 1 equals 1
  ok 3 # skip because
  not ok 4 - 1 equals 2
  ok 5 - 1 == 2 # TODO because

into

  $ metatap --planned=5 --ok=2 --failed=1 --skip=1 --todo=0

it will produce the following (TAP) output:

  1..6
  ok 1 - Expected number of passed tests (excluding skip and toto tests) == 2
  ok 2 - Expected number of planned tests == 5
  ok 3 # skip Expected number of passed tests (including skip and toto tests) not specified
  ok 4 - Expected number of failed tests == 1
  not ok 5 - Expected number of todo tests == 0
  ok 6 - Expected number of skipped tests == 1

adding the --runtests option, the produced TAP will be run in a TAP::Harness, 
yielding:

  TAP .. Failed 1/6 subtests 
          (less 1 skipped subtest: 4 okay)
